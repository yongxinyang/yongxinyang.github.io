Computers reach nearly every part of life. Mobile payment, online order and delivery, online appointment, social media, and more areas like these are impossible to be on the stage without software engineering. Knowing how languages, algorithms, and logic are involved in the creation of a project as well as how cybersecurity is achieved against the growing hacking techniques is fascinating. Realizing what is in my mind and entertaining others’ lives using software engineering is magically attractive. Software engineers are the ones responsible for developing, designing, testing, writing, modifying, and debugging software based on specific requirements. So you can see,  a great software engineer does require a certain set of skills to achieve a certain set of desires, and taking the time to hone these skills is worthwhile.


##Coding languages 
There are a variety of coding languages. The accomplishment of a computer program or a system may need the integration of multiple languages. Programming languages are like culinary ingredients, each of them has its unique characteristics. Whether or not a programmer is fluent in these languages decides how much he can do on a comprehensive project. Ideally, by learning different languages, I can improve my composing skills to a level I am satisfied with.


##Problem-solving and logical-thinking 
A skilled programmer should be able to take a complex problem, break it down into smaller pieces, solve each of those pieces, and then put everything back together to solve the initial problem. To resolve a real life issue quickly and effectively, logical thinking is crucial to build up an ultimate and satisfactory solution and achieve it using coding skills. Through practicing and debugging, I am hoping to keep my mind active and energetic.  

##Creativity 
A programmer’s job involves creative work. The solutions to a specific problem could be various. Using imagination to generate new ideas and improve the user interface is how creativity becomes helpful in this field. Through exploring the CS field, in addition to gaining more knowledge and becoming familiar with more professional skills, I hope to grow up becoming a creative person. With the ability to look at things from a unique perspective and find patterns and make connections to find opportunities, I aim to be more self-motivated even when times are tough.
